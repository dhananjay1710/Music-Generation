# Music-Generation

This project uses a standarad LSTM network along with the music21 library (primarily) to study and identify patterns in music notes, thus generating them. Essentially, the trained model looks at the previous n (n = 50 or 100) notes, to predict the n+1 th note successfully.

## Implementaion: 

For complete implementation along with the trained model's weight, one may refer to this drive link:

Open and run JazzGeneration.ipynb. The steps are simple and self explanatory. Do run pip install music21, as it is an extra library.
